# adblock-bookmarklet
A bookmarklet to remove ads.
Because I don't like ads and you shouldn't need a chrome extension to block ads...

## How to use
- Copy text from [`dist/release/bookmarklet.min.txt`](dist/release/bookmarklet.min.txt)
- Set as bookmark and click on the bookmark to remove ads
- Or paste text into URL bar (but make sure it starts with `javascript:`)

## Reporting bugs
- If it doesn't block some ads, or removes legitimate content, please [open an issue](https://github.com/MarcellPerger1/adblock-bookmarklet/issues/new)
- In the issue, please include a URL of the website where it doesn't work (otherwise I won't be able to fix it)
