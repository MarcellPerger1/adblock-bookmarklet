# adblock-bookmarklet
A bookmarklet to remove ads.
Because I don't like ads and you shouldn't need a chrome extension to block ads...

## How to use
- Copy text from [`dist/release/bookmarklet.min.txt`](dist/release/bookmarklet.min.txt)
- Set as bookmark and click on the bookmark to remove ads
- Or paste text into URL bar (but make sure it starts with `javascript:`)
